                <h2> Name : Rana Amteer </h2> 
                <p>In this exercise, the idea is to write a paragraph that would be a random passage from a story. An effective paragraph is one that has unity (it isn’t a hodgepodge of things), focus (everything in the paragraph stacks up to the whatever-it-is the paragraph is about), and coherence (the content follows smoothly). For this exercise, the paragraph should be quick to read--say, not be more than 100 words long.

                        A paragraph needn’t be several sentences long, but might be only a sentence or two, or a single line of dialogue.
                        
                        Or it could be a snippet of dialogue with narration:ers there to attempt the subterranean labyrinth when it had opened as a commercial venture.
